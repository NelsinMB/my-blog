        <p>
          Hi, I'm Nelsin Martin-Burnett â€“ a graduate from McGill University. There I studied Mathematics & Computer Science. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Currently, I am in the process of trying out new things, and this happens to be one of them. I've wanted to create a website for some time now - to host & share my recipes, and to show case my projects. 
        </p>
        <p>
          I hope you enjoy :)
